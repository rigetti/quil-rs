[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import quil`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the

# "cdylib" is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.

# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use quil;` unless the "lib" and "rlib" crate type is also included:
