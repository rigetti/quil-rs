//! Types for tracking read and write dependencies in a control flow graph.
//!
//! During scheduling, we want to be able to order a variety of operations whose semantics are
//! *sequentially consistent*: all "reads" must see the *same* most recent "write", for the
//! appropriate notion of "read" and "write".  The [`DependencyQueue`] type allows enforcing this
//! constraint, with the notion of "read" and "write" being given by the [`Access`] trait.

///   and an enum value telling you whether that instruction performed a read or a write.

/// 1. All writes must happen-before subsequent reads.
/// 2. All reads must happen-before subsequent writes.
/// 3. There are no dependencies between reads.
///
///  This allows scheduling to reorder reads without allowing them to lose track of where their
///  value came from.
///
/// This queue keeps track of the most recent write access to the resource, if any, as well as all
/// reads that have been performed since that write.  Every access (read or write)
/// [recorded][Self::record_access_and_get_dependencies] after that write access incurs a dependency
/// on said write.  When a subsequent write access is performed, it incurs as a dependency both the
/// prior most recent write as well as all outstanding reads; this new write becomes the most recent
/// write, with no reads that have been performed since it.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// If there are two writers, the second has a dependency on the first:
///
/// ```text
/// writer 1 ───▶ writer 2
/// ```

///
/// ```text
/// writer 1 ─┬──▶ reader 1
///           ├──▶ reader 2
///           └──▶ reader 3
/// ```
///
/// If there are both readers and writers that are interleaved, then we can get a writer that both
/// has a reader as a dependency and is itself a dependency of a reader, producing an ordering
/// constraint between two readers even though readers never get direct dependency edges between
/// each other:
