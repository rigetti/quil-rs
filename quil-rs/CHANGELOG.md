## 0.17.0

### Breaking Changes

- The `Infix`, `Prefix`, and `FunctionCall` variants of `Expression` are no longer struct variants. They now are tuple variants with an inner `InfixExpression`, `PrefixExpression`, and `FunctionCallExpression`, respectively.
- The `GateType` and `GateSpecification` enums now include a `PauliSum` variant.
- `program::error::ProgramError<T>` has been renamed to `ParseProgramError<T>`
- `Program` methods that return a result now use `program::ProgramError` as the error type.
- `Program.to_headers()` has been removed. This has affected two other methods:
    - `Program.to_string()` is now implemented via `std::fmt::Display` and doesn't take an argument to include "headers", they are always included in the string.
    - `Program.to_instructions()` no longer takes an argument to include headers, what were called "headers" are always included.
- `CalibrationSet::get_match_for_gate` now takes a single `Gate` as a parameter.

### Features

- `PauliSum` `GateSpecification`s are now supported.
- All instruction types now have a `new` constructor, which perform extra validation, if appropriate.
- The `Gate` type now has methods for applying `DAGGER`, `CONTROLLED`, and `FORKED` modifiers.
- `SWAP-PHASES` is now supported.
- `WAIT` is now supported.
- `DECLARE` with offset and sharing is now supported.
- `Program`s can now be appended with the `+` operator.
- `get` and `insert` methods have been added to `FrameSet`
- `CalibrationSet` now has getter methods for `calibrations` and `measure_calibrations`.
- `CalibrationSet` now has a `get_match_for_measurement` method.
- `Program` now has a `dagger` method for applying `DAGGER` modifiers to all gates in a program.

### Fixes

- Casing is now ignored when parsing function call expressions.
- Parameters now include the leading `%` when printed with `std::fmt::Display`.
- `DEFCAL MEASURE` can now be parsed with a variable qubit and an address, instead of just one or the other.
