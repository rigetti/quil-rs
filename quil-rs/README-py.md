# Quil

⚠️ In Development

The `quil` Python package provides tools for
constructing, manipulating, parsing, and printing [Quil][quil-spec] programs.
Internally, it is powered by [`quil-rs`][].

It should be considered unstable until the release of v1.0.

## Documentation

Documentation for the current release of `quil` is published [here][quil-py-docs].
Every version of `quil` ships [with type stubs][quil-py-stubs]
that provide type hints and documentation to Python tooling
and editors that support the [Language Server Protocol][] or similar.
