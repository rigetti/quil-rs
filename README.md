# Quil Parser & Program Builder

This repository is the home of [`quil-rs`][] and [`quil-py`][],
tools for working with [Quil][quil-spec] programs in Rust and Python.

- [`quil-rs`][] is the main Rust crate and Python bindings.
- [`quil-cli`][] is a tool to validate a [Quil][quil-spec] program or expression.

These libraries should be considered unstable until the release of v1.0.

Note: For Rigetti's Python library for quantum programming with Quil, you likely want [`pyQuil`][].
This code serves as the foundation of that library,
but `pyQuil` offers higher-level abstractions and greater stability guarantees.
